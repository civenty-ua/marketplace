We have an idea for the production of dried fruits, such products from an economic point of view more interesting. Assorted dried fruits, packed in beautiful bags, would be a popular and healthy snack for schoolchildren. There is also an idea to make fruit rolls with sesame seeds, sunflower kernels.
